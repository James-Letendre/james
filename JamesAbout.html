	<p1> I was originally born in Orlando Florida on April 16, 2001. I only lived there for two years and moved to Longmeadow Mass where I have been living for all of my life. I started playing hockey at a very young age and have loved the sport ever sense. My family up into very recently built a rink in our backyard to skate on during the winter. I also grew up loving the ocean as we have a house on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. I have been surfing, skimbording, and swimming in the ocean my whole life. I hve met some of my best friends from the summer and it is a large part of me. These are parts of my life that describe my personality and some of different things that are unique to me.  </p1>
